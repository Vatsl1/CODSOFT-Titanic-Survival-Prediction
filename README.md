# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical data.

## 📊 Dataset
The Titanic dataset (commonly from Kaggle) contains data on passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 ML Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## 📌 Features Used
- Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

## 🧪 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells in order
3. Model and evaluation will display survival prediction results
